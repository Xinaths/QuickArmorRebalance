Code is a bit of a mess, due to being a bit larger then originally planned and I was trying a different approach then I usually take and it didn't really work out.

If you want to easily add imgui to your own project, feel free to grab ImGuiIntegration.h/.cpp files as a starting point, it should have everything you need in code. Note that I take no significant credit for the contents of those files, they are mostly pulled from other projects and simply put in one place.
